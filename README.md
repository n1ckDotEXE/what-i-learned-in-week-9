##Intervals:

Intervals are measured in milliseconds. In order to calculate seconds, you have to increment by 1000 seconds. Default is 0.

Syntax: setInterval(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)
- run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval

Syntax: setTimeout(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)
- Runs function not only once, but at regularly at given interval

clearInterval and clearTimeout to escape.

##Console.clear()

Used for clearing the console of text. The program is still running.
